In Canada, there is a substantial economic and humanistic burden from COPD.3 Individuals living with COPD experience many pulmonary and extra-pulmonary symptoms, affecting their overall quality of life and limiting their daily activities.3,6 There is increased attention on the impact of climate change on weather exposures and the effects on chronic lung diseases7 and their global health burden.8 Global climate change has increased the mean yearly ambient temperature, frequency and intensity of variable weather conditions.9 Increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have increased climatic temperatures, causing events of severe and prolonged heat waves, increased air pollution, and temperature variabilities.10 In Canada, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are predicted to increase as a result of climate variability.11 Poor air quality and extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) have been found to directly damage the lungs by inducing inflammatory responses, which may increase susceptibility to infections and risk of exacerbations.12 As a result, temperature and humidity extremes affect the lung function of individuals with COPD13 Sama et al.14 completed a cross-sectional survey examining environmental influences in individuals with COPD in Massachusetts, USA. They found that 78% of study participants were affected by hot/humid and cold/dry weather, 81% “finding it harder to breathe” in hot/humid weather, and 67% in cold/dry weather. Weather was only one of several different exposure variables they investigated; however, their impact on health outcomes was not assessed."

Extremes of temperature and humidity have been associated with increases in adverse respiratory symptoms,9,15,16 reduced lung function,9,16–18 decreased health status,15,17 increased use of rescue inhalers9,16,19,20 decreased physical activity (PA),15,21,22 and increased exacerbations15,17,19,20 and hospitalizations.15,23–25 Of these studies, one conducted across Canada focused only on the effects of daily variation of weather on PA,21 and another in Northwestern, USA collected information on respiratory symptoms, exacerbations, and rescue inhaler use in cold temperatures only.9 There is a lack of evidence describing both the burden of extreme weather conditions on individuals with COPD and the impact on important health outcomes.17,25 There is also a lack of research conducted in Canada, limiting the generalizability of past results to individuals with COPD living in Canada. The primary objective of this study was to determine what proportion of individuals with COPD were affected by extremes of weather (hot/humid and cold/dry) regarding their health status and respiratory symptoms. The secondary objective of this study was to determine the associations between extremes of weather and health status, respiratory symptoms, PA, frequency of exacerbations, rescue inhaler use, and healthcare utilization in individuals with COPD."

Introduction A respiratory tract infection (RTI) is a medical condition affecting either the upper, lower or both parts of the respiratory system. Upper RTIs include diseases such as the common cold, sinusitis, pharyngitis and laryngitis. Furthermore, lower RTIs include bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia (1, 2)."

Furthermore, lower RTIs include bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia (1, 2). In 2021 the global number of new episodes of upper RTIs was 12.8 billion and accounted for 19,600 deaths (1). Concerning lower RTIs, an estimated 344 million incident episodes and 2.18 million deaths occurred in 2021 (2). COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can affect both the upper and lower respiratory tract and with either a mild or severe course of the illness."

The impact of the COVID-19 infections has also been substantial, and 15.9 million deaths related to the pandemic were registered between 2020 and 2021 (3). In summary, RTIs are a significant global public health concern. Urban design has been shown to influence health in many ways (4) and can also affect the spread and occurrence of RTIs."

Urban design has been shown to influence health in many ways (4) and can also affect the spread and occurrence of RTIs. For example, suggested important drivers for the spread of COVID-19 infections in urban areas are population density, land use, transportation, mobility, housing conditions, demographic, socio-economic, and health-related factors (5). Also, weather parameters, such as temperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation, may independently, or in interaction with each other relate to contracting a RTI (6). This would occur because weather could influence the stability of viral pathogens in droplets and aerosols of air or influence transmission through altering the host airway defense, as well as behavior of humans (degree of outdoor exposure) (7)."

Previous studies suggest that both temperature and humidity of urban areas affect the risk of contracting RTI (6, 8). Wind has also been shown to be associated with the occurrence of RTIs which could occur either through increasing the spread or diluting the number of airborne pathogens in the environment (9). Low wind speed in cities worsens air pollution (10) and could also indirectly affect the risk of contracting RTIs (11)."

Low wind speed in cities worsens air pollution (10) and could also indirectly affect the risk of contracting RTIs (11). UV-radiation could also increase the occurrence of RTIs, but the available scientific evidence is scarce (8). To our knowledge, empirical evidence of the exposures of weather on the occurrence of RTIs is either inconclusive (temperature, humidity) or largely lacking (wind, UV-radiation).

For example, the ambient temperature in cities is affected both by characteristics of the built environment and human activity. Urban built structures, such as the height and shape of buildings, their materials and orientation toward the sun, as well as roads and pavements contribute to heat radiation and moisture evaporation (12). In addition, parks and overall greenness can significantly affect evaporative cooling and overall temperature of cities (13, 14)."

In addition, parks and overall greenness can significantly affect evaporative cooling and overall temperature of cities (13, 14). Because of both the anthropogenic activities and urban built environments, city centers are warmer than the surrounding areas. Traditionally, this urban heat island (UHI) effect has been defined as the difference in near-surface air temperature between the urban core and its rural hinterland (10, 15). The flow of wind of urban areas can also be influenced by the density, height/width, location and even shapes of buildings, as well as the arrangement of streets in cities and structures produced by nature (16, 17)."

Also, higher temperatures of UHIs can create vertical temperature gradients that influence the mixing of air and affect wind patterns (18). The surrounding environment of cities (mountain basins, valleys) can further influence the wind flow to and away from the city by controlling wind direction (10). To our knowledge research is lacking on the potential influence of heterogeneity in exposure to weather within urban districts and neighborhoods that are affected by urban built environments, and that could also relate to the occurrence of respiratory infections."

Closely spaced buildings can trap heat and reduce natural ventilation which contributes to higher temperatures within cities (61)."

Population density and other urban environment characteristics Our results showed that the population density was the most studied urban characteristic of interest in the selected studies. The main observation was that cities with higher population density had more RTIs than those with lower population density irrespective of the city size. In densely populated areas, people are more likely to be in close connection to one another, increasing the potential for respiratory pathogens to spread from person to person mainly through airborne transmission (75)."

Spread of RTIs is not only a question of the challenge related to the characteristics and internal dynamics of cities, but also of the connections between cities and the mobility of people. Densely populated urban areas often have extensive public transportation systems, which can serve as national and international hubs for infection transmission as people are in close contact on buses, subways, trains, and airplanes (77–79). This also allows the pathogens to move quickly within or between the cities (79, 80). In a Japanese study, the use of public transportation and the time spent commuting increased the risk of COVID-19 infection (81)."

Each user can select the AQI level at which he or she wants to be notified (e.g., unhealthy for sensitive groups) and whether to receive forecasts and/or real-time air quality levels. When the AQI is forecast to be at or above that level, or reaches that level in near real-time, notification is sent. The message includes the same air quality information that the local radio or television stations provide, plus suggested safety measures when levels are unhealthy."

Your patients can reduce their exposures simply by taking it easier when particle pollution levels are at unhealthy levels. They can reduce their exposure by reducing the time they spend being active outdoors (e.g., gardening 30 minutes instead of an hour), by reducing the intensity of outdoor activity (e.g., jogging instead of running), or by being active outdoors when air quality is better. The intake dose of pollution inhaled is equal to the product of the ambient concentration, ventilation rate (per minute) and duration of the exposure (Intake Dose = ambient concentration x minute ventilation rate x time in minutes). Note that the intake dose of particles is greater than the deposited dose in the respiratory tract since a portion of inhaled particles are exhaled."

How can my patients reduce particle pollution exposure near roadways? There are two simple ways your patients can reduce exposures from particle pollution on roadways: - Walkers, runners, and bikers can reduce their particle pollution exposure by planning times and routes that avoid busy roads. - Drivers can reduce exposure to particle pollution by keeping the vehicle ventilation setting on ""recirculate"" when driving on busy roads (Hudda et."

For air quality advisories to have a positive effect on public health, they must be widely available and well-understood. Evidence indicates the air quality alerts are helpful and advocacy from health care professionals is powerful. In 2005, six states (Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin) included questions about how environmental factors and the AQI affect people’s activity levels in the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System (BRFSS)."

In 2005, six states (Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin) included questions about how environmental factors and the AQI affect people’s activity levels in the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System (BRFSS). In Kansas, this survey showed that when a health care professional advised people to change their outdoor activity level when air quality is unhealthy, both awareness of the AQI and behavior change increased. Specifically, people were almost four times as likely to change outdoor activity levels if they were advised by a health care professional. However, only a small percentage of people in groups at increased risk from particle pollution (16 percent of adults with asthma and 5 percent of adults 65 years and older) were advised to pay attention to the AQI by a health care professional (Kansas Department of Health and Environment, 2006)."

An analysis of the six states’ data in the BRFSS indicated that those that had ever received a health professional’s advice about the AQI were two to three times more likely to report a change in outdoor activity based on an air quality alert. Specifically, those with lifetime asthma were almost twice as likely (from 31 percent to 57 percent) and those without asthma more than three times as likely (from 16 percent to 51 percent) to report a change in outdoor activity based on an air quality alert (Wen et al., 2009)."

The AQI advisories for particle pollution have not been in place as long as those for ozone, so, currently, there is no evidence of reductions in particle pollution exposures, morbidity, or mortality due to averting behaviors in response to particle pollution advisories. However, we can infer that averting behavior, similar to that reported in response to ozone advisories discussed below, is likely to occur as the public becomes educated about the risks associated with particle pollution exposures and how to reduce them. Studies focusing on ozone provide evidence indicating the importance of air quality alerts in altering individual behavior that may be applicable to particle pollution exposures."

Studies focusing on ozone provide evidence indicating the importance of air quality alerts in altering individual behavior that may be applicable to particle pollution exposures. In a Southern California study, attendance at two outdoor facilities (i.e., a zoo and an observatory) was reduced by 6-13 percent on days when ozone alerts were announced, with greater decreases observed among children and older adults (Neidell, 2009). Several studies show evidence of individual-averting behaviors in response to air quality advisories, especially for populations potentially at increased risk of a particle pollution-related health effect, such as children, older adults, and people with asthma.

Children with asthma who spent at least some time outdoors reduced their total time spent outdoors by an average of 30 minutes on a “code red” ozone day (AQI category is Unhealthy) relative to a code green, yellow, or orange day. However, the authors noted that there was appreciable variation in both the overall amount of time spent outdoors and the reduction in outdoor time on high ozone days among children with asthma, with the reductions seen in children whose parents reported that they were sensitive to air pollution.
