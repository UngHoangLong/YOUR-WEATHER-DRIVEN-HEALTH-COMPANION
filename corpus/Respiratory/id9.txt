Usually, respiratory disease will affect most of us during winter due to the cold air, flu season, and more indoor pollution. Have ever imagined that summer heat could take a toll on your respiratory health? For individuals with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, or other lung conditions, the hot and humid summer air can act as a silent trigger, this will worsen the situation and even breathing becomes harder. Further, this blog will unclose how summer heat disturbs the respiratory system and what you can do to protect yourself. Why is summer heat a problem for respiratory health? Some of us will feel energized during these hot days of the year, but for a few with underlying respiratory conditions, it will intensify their symptoms. Further, let’s see how summer heat affects respiratory health: High temperature increases airway irritation: - The summer heat will narrow and inflame the airways, notably in individuals with asthma or COPD. - Automatically you will breathe faster, which brings more irritants and allergens into the lungs. Increased air pollution: - During the summer this heat will react with car exhaust and industrial waste and form a ground-level ozone, a harmful pollutant. - This high ozone level also remains a significant trigger for asthma, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Humidity and mold growth: - High humidity will promote the growth of mold, and dust mites, these are common allergy and asthma triggers. - Further, the air will feel heavier due to this, eventually, those with compromised lungs will find it hard even to breathe. Pollen and allergens spike in summer: - Trees, grasses, and weeds will release pollen, which will worsen seasonal allergic rhinitis and result in asthma flare-ups. - This causes problems when it gets mixed with poor air quality and high temperatures. What are the symptoms of high humidity levels? High temperatures can cause several noticeable symptoms. You will feel sticky or sweaty even when you are not engaging in any activities, and also the air feels heavier or harder to breathe. Some of the common signs include: - Headache - Dizziness - Poor sleep quality Further, due to this increased temperature will worsen allergies and asthma, as they encourage the growth of mold, dust mites, and bacteria. Check for musty odors, condensation on windows, or damp walls. When overlooked, high humidity can result in respiratory discomfort and overall reduced indoor air quality. Whenever you feel like your symptoms are getting severe, consider visiting the best pulmonologist in Coimbatore to get the desired outcomes. How does the temperature affect your respiratory system? Temperature plays a most important role in how well your respiratory system is functioning. Cold air will irritate your airways, causing them to constrict, which will result in shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing notably in individuals who are affected by asthma or COPD. Further, moisture in your airways can be reduced by cold or dry air, eventually, you will find it harder even to breathe comfortably. While hot and humid weather will make the air feel heavier, and add more strain on your lungs. Further, it increases the pollutants and allergens levels such as ozone, pollen, and mold which will trigger the respiratory symptoms. Excess heat will worsen the conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. In both extreme weather conditions, your lungs need to work super hard to adapt, and this will make the underlying respiratory problem more severe. Thus, it’s crucial to check the weather and air quality, stay hydrated, and avoid staying outdoors for long periods or engaging in some activities to safeguard your lung health. So, we can say that there is a strong connection between the temperature and your respiratory system. Is heat bad for asthma? Of course, heat can cause adverse effects on your health, that too asthma patients will suffer a lot. High temperatures, notably when combined with humidity and air pollution, can make asthma symptoms more severe. As we mentioned above, hot air can affect the airways, causing them to become inflamed and narrow, resulting in wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, or even asthma attacks. Heat will increase the ground-level ozone levels, which is a harmful pollutant that will impair the prevention of respiratory diseases. Notably, individuals with asthma will find it harder to breathe and feel more fatigued during these extremely hot seasons of the year. One of the ways to prevent this condition is staying indoors during the peak heat hours, using air conditioning, and always keeping medications handy. What are the common respiratory problems? - Asthma: Asthma is one of the inflammatory diseases which causes recurrent obstruction of airflow to the lungs. The common signs include wheezing sound, trouble breathing, and chest tightness. Often hot and humid environments trigger asthma. Simply, the summer season will increase the moisture level in the air. Moisture levels in the air will be increased during the summer months and airborne allergens presence will be increased like dust mites or pollen into the air. Further, frequent rains during the summer and high temperatures in the daytime will increase the effects of allergens on the lungs. - Anxiety-related respiratory problems: Even a few studies have suggested that hot weather increases the risk of shortness of breath caused by anxiety and depression. Particularly these hot seasons are more stressful for people who are sensitive to heat. In case when the individual’s body gets bogged down by the high temperatures, your body needs to work extra hard to cool itself down. During this procedure, you will inhale more air. When stress and utilization of air get combined shortness of breath will occur when associated with anxiety or depressive disorder. - Heat stroke: Prolonged exposure to heat temperatures will increase the risk of heat stroke. The signs that indicate the presence of heat stroke include dizziness, exhaustion, severe headaches, and seizures. Heat strokes can result in life-threatening conditions when the patient is not treated immediately. Does extremely hot weather affect your breathing? In case, the temperature rises, you confront stagnant air and pollution will increase, so you will find it hard to breathe properly. You need more oxygen to maintain internal temperature when those extremities are too high, that is either too cold or heat. The weather will greatly disturb your lung functionality which may result in rapid breathing or hyperpnea. Few studies have indicated that, during the summer season the count of pollen in the air will be increased. Also, this sudden surge will trigger respiratory symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath issues from respiratory illnesses like asthma, or COPD. Simply, hot air has the potential to irritate your airways and trigger cough in individuals affected by the inflammatory disease of the upper airways. When the thermal sensors in the upper airways and larynx get activated irritation will occur. Further, studies have shown that hot air causes swelling in the airways and will cause shortness of breath and bronchoconstriction. As all we know, dehydration is very common during hot weather, it will dry out the nasal passages, bronchial tubes, and lungs leading to shortness of breath. Further, individuals with chronic lung issues will find it difficult to breathe dense air. Simply, during the hot temperatures, the air will become stagnant and will trap the pollutants and worsen the respiratory symptoms. Are there any ways to avoid summer-related respiratory diseases? - Stay indoors: As all, we know summer is not at all the best time to stay outdoors, you can stay away from those allergens by lowering the time you spend outdoors. Also, when staying indoors, prefer air-conditioned rooms. The air conditioner will keep the air dry and cool, this cool air will reduce the chance of asthma and other respiratory ailments triggered by hot temperatures. - Use light clothing: In case you are going out, plan to wear light clothing. Typically, lighter clothes will greatly help in effectively cooling your body. While dark colored or thick clothing will cause body temperature to shoot up. - Stay hydrated: Typically we will sweat more than normal during the summer season so it’s crucial to replenish those lost bodily fluids. Consume more water and stay away from caffeinated drinks and other sugary beverages. - Alleviate indoor heat: Try to avoid binge-using the heat-generating appliances in your home during these hot temperatures. Those common heat-producing devices include ovens, stoves, dishwashers and also clothes dryers. In case, often you are using these appliances, there are more chances of increased temperature. - Carry the medications: In case you are already suffering from lung disease, always carry the medications with you. Take proactive steps to avoid unnecessary things. - Quit smoking: In case you have a habit of smoking, plan to quit it because it will assist you in improving your breathing and lung function. Further, limiting alcohol also assists you because it prevents dehydration. - Avoid over-exercising: During the summer you need to conserve more energy and stop doing strenuous activities such as running, cycling, or vigorous exercise. - Changes to your diet: You need to consume more water and also try incorporating foods with high water content. You can consider eating watermelons, mangoes, musk melons, and cucumbers. - Cool down your body: Whenever feeling overwhelmed, take frequent showers. When heading outdoors use a hat, scarf, shrug, or umbrella to cover your body. Simply, those extreme hot temperatures will affect everyone, also individuals with pre-existing lung conditions are at more risk of developing adverse health problems. If you or any of your family members are affected by breathing issues due to extremely hot temperatures, consider reaching out to the healthcare provider at the right time. Does AC reduce humidity? Yes, air conditioners (AC) will assist you in reducing humidity. They will cool the air, this will remove moisture, and assist you in developing a comfortable environment. Whenever warm, humid air passes over the AC’s cold evaporator coils, the moisture condenses into water droplets and is drained away. This method assists in reducing indoor humidity levels and makes it easier to breathe, notably for individuals with asthma or allergies. Less humidity will prevent mold growth and enhance overall air quality. To get the desired results, try maintaining your AC well-maintained and using a dehumidifier in very cooler climates for more humidity control. Who is at risk and when to consult a doctor? No one is exceptional to this summer heat, but a few are more vulnerable, like: - Individuals with respiratory issues like asthma, COPD, bronchitis, and emphysema. - Kids and senior citizens. - People with compromised immune systems. - Individuals with heart disease. - People who spend most of their time outdoors like athletes and few workers. An individual should consider reaching out to the best pulmonology hospital in Coimbatore for help when experiencing: - Chronic shortness of breath - Wheezing or chest tightness that remains the same - Blue fingers or lips - High fever and confusion - No improvement even with medications Simply early intervention can prevent complications and hospitalization. Final thoughts: In conclusion, we can say that, while these hot temperatures and sunshine are welcome changes for many, they can be increasingly dangerous for people with respiratory problems. Heat, pollution, allergens, and humidity altogether can develop a hostile environment for the lungs. Just by staying informed, planning your day around air quality reports, and managing your health proactively, you can greatly enjoy the summer safely without respiratory disease holding you back.
