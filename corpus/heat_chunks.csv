Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50. For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older. The study in Friday’s journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35."

These objectives are critical pathways to identify and communicate effective approaches to cope with present and future heat challenges. Discussion: We hypothesize six key reasons epidemiological studies have found little impact of humidity on heat–health outcomes: a) At high temperatures, there may be limited influence of humidity on the health conditions that cause most heat-related deaths (i.e., cardiovascular collapse); b) epidemiological data sets have limited spatial extent, a bias toward extratropical (i.e., cooler and less humid), high-income nations, and tend to exist in places where temporal variations in temperature and humidity are positively correlated; c) analyses focus on older, vulnerable populations with sweating, and thus evaporative, impairments that may be further aggravated by dehydration; d) extremely high levels of temperature and humidity (seldom seen in the historical record) are necessary for humidity to substantially impact heat strain of sedentary individuals; e) relationships between temperature and humidity are improperly considered when interpreting epidemiological model results; and f) sub-daily meteorological phenomena, such as rain, occur at high temperatures and humidity, and may bias epidemiological studies based on daily data. Future research must robustly test these hypotheses to advance methods for more accurate incorporation of humidity in estimating heat-related health outcomes under present and projected future climates.

This extra water vapor gets transported over land regions, which can see increases in specific humidity, although these increases tend to be smaller than over oceans because some of the moisture rains out as it is transported. Although specific humidity changes over land are generally slower than the 6–7%/°C Clausius–Clapeyron scaling, they are much larger than the fractional changes in temperature.49 The result is that increases in specific humidity dominate changes in moist heat in all but the coldest, driest climates,49 and projecting changes in moist heat largely comes down to projecting changes in specific humidity.

Physiological Study of Humidity in Heat Stress and Strain Physiological studies have concluded that increasing humidity along with increasing temperature should pose significant risks for human health.14,45 It is well established in the physiology and biophysics literature that ambient humidity plays a critical role in whether human core temperature can be maintained within safe limits. To prevent accumulation of excess heat energy inside the body and the elevated risk of hyperthermia and heat stroke, the bloodstream must transport metabolically generated heat to the skin surface."

To prevent accumulation of excess heat energy inside the body and the elevated risk of hyperthermia and heat stroke, the bloodstream must transport metabolically generated heat to the skin surface. To do so, the skin’s vasculature dilates (cutaneous vasodilation) and then dissipates this heat to the surrounding environment.30 Heat transfer away from the body can occur via dry transfer processes (convection and radiation), but the magnitude of these losses diminishes as increases. Above , the only remaining avenue for heat dissipation is evaporation, almost exclusively from sweat secreted by the eccrine glands distributed across the human skin.26 Each gram of sweat can liberate up to 2,427 J of latent heat if completely evaporated from the skin.54As ambient humidity rises, the proportion of secreted sweat that evaporates (i.e., sweating efficiency) decreases, with the remainder either sitting on the skin or dripping off the body without contributing to latent cooling (i.e., inefficient sweating).55 Because less heat is lost for a given sweat rate at high humidity, core temperature continues to rise until enough sweat is secreted to elicit the required rate of evaporation to attain thermal equilibrium."

Humidity as a Confounder Many studies consider, implicitly or explicitly, humidity as a confounder in the relationship between temperature metrics and health outcomes.70–72 Humidity is typically adjusted for in such analyses. Consider the following multivariable linear model where Y represents a given health outcome rate (e.g., daily rates of nonaccidental mortality per 100,000), t is daily mean temperature, h is daily absolute humidity, and c′ is a vector of confounders (including calendar variables): Assuming no interaction on the additive scale and a linear dose–response effect for simplicity, represents the intercept, and the effect of t conditioning on both h and c′. The coefficients and (under some assumptions73) can be interpreted as the controlled direct effect, although interpreting such coefficients can be misleading.74,75 A first challenge is that by conditioning (i.e., adjusting) on humidity levels, we deliberately remove the influence of humidity on both temperature and the health outcome."

Possible Physiological Reasons for Epidemiological Results Potential physiological reasons for the disconnect on humidity’s role in heat stress between physiological and epidemiological studies include the following: Sweating impairments in heat-vulnerable people. Progressive impairments in the human sweating response occur naturally with aging owing to reduced peripheral sensitivity to acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter predominantly responsible for eccrine sweating, and atrophy of the sweat glands.93 Above the age of 60 y, thermoregulatory sweating can decline by up to 25%, although these impairments can be delayed by regular aerobic training.94 Anticholinergic medications, such as many antidepressants and psychotropic medicines, also theoretically attenuate sweating,95 as do other medications that alter peripheral vasodilation, such as anti-adrenergics and beta-blockers.96 Advanced age, poor health, and taking prescription medications are leading risk factors for heat-related morbidity and mortality.2 Those who get sick or die during heat waves likely have reduced sweating capacity; thus, it is possible that these individuals are consequently less sensitive to impairments of heat dissipation from elevated humidity (i.e., the effects of high humidity are less). - Environmental thresholds at which differences in humidity impact thermoregulatory strain are rarely attained."

Rather, the leading causes of death are conditions such as cardiovascular disease.100 There is little evidence that these diseases directly impair thermoregulation; but there is a strong rationale for heat exposure, somewhat independent of humidity, aggravating these disease states such that catastrophic failure of a major physiological system is more likely.101 Using cardiovascular disease as an example, exposure to high ambient temperatures initially elicits cutaneous vasodilation triggered by rising skin temperature.102 As more blood flows toward the skin, cardiac output is elevated to maintain central blood pressure, primarily by increasing heart rate.103,104 This greater cardiovascular work requires more oxygen to be delivered to cardiac myocytes by the blood flowing through the coronary arteries.105 Indeed, sedentary exposure to simulated heat waves increased the heart rate and rate–pressure product (an index of the heart’s oxygen requirements) by up to .106 Underlying infirmities, such as atherosclerosis of the heart’s major blood vessels, then create clear mechanistic pathways for heat exposure to cause potentially deadly cardiovascular events."

Humidity’s ambiguous role in heat-related health outcomes makes it difficult to optimize adaptation strategies, now and under future warming. At the individual level, the efficacy of personal cooling strategies may be affected by humidity.117 For example, electric fans, which require a fraction of the energy and cost of air conditioning, are effective cooling devices in high humidity conditions, but at the same (if is greater than skin temperature) can prove detrimental under low humidity.106 Reasons why humidity matters (or not) could also influence adaptation effectiveness."

At the individual level, the efficacy of personal cooling strategies may be affected by humidity.117 For example, electric fans, which require a fraction of the energy and cost of air conditioning, are effective cooling devices in high humidity conditions, but at the same (if is greater than skin temperature) can prove detrimental under low humidity.106 Reasons why humidity matters (or not) could also influence adaptation effectiveness. For example, if humidity does not play a large role in heat–health impacts because of sweating impairments in vulnerable populations (i.e., the elderly), then self-dousing (applying water to the skin) to increase heat transfer from the skin surface during heat waves could improve health outcomes. Self-dousing could also overcome the lessened efficacy of fans at low humidity observed in older populations in climate chamber experiments.118 An improved understanding of humidity’s role would also influence city-level adaptation measures."

At present, some heat wave early warning systems only consider temperature, whereas others consider both temperature and humidity, or composite metrics (e.g., AT).119 If humidity matters for heat–health outcomes, and is increasing with global warming, warning systems should perhaps be revised to more consistently include humidity or use composite temperature–humidity metrics. The intensity of the urban heat island (UHI), and thus effective methods to mitigate UHIs, also depend on humidity.120 For example, green roofs and street vegetation may enhance humidity, whereas white roofs and reflective pavement would likely have a neutral effect on humidity.121 At a range of scales, from personal to regional, we assert that better understanding humidity’s role in heat–health outcomes would clarify effective heat adaptation strategies. Summary and Conclusions We sought to understand the disconnect between physiologists and epidemiologists regarding humidity’s role in health outcomes of elevated heat, and hypothesize possible reasons for the differing conclusions."

Summary and Conclusions We sought to understand the disconnect between physiologists and epidemiologists regarding humidity’s role in health outcomes of elevated heat, and hypothesize possible reasons for the differing conclusions. In climate chamber experiments and human energy balance modeling, physiologists find a key role for humidity in driving human heat strain; at high levels of humidity, efficiency of sweating—the main mechanism by which the human body cools itself—decreases.18,22,122 In contrast, epidemiologists conducting time-series analyses comparing health outcomes (i.e., morbidity and mortality) with environmental drivers typically find a negligible role for humidity.19 We argue that reconciling these diverging views of humidity is critical in a changing climate. As concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gasses continue to rise, ambient temperature will increase, as will specific humidity over most land regions.20,123 As a result, both the rate and pattern of the increase in moist heat with global warming are distinctly different from that of temperature alone: Although temperature generally exhibits polar-amplified warming, moist heat exhibits tropical-amplified increases.49,116 Humidity’s role in heat–health outcomes thus could substantially alter projections of health burdens from climate change. Disentangling humidity’s impacts on heat-related health outcomes is also necessary to select appropriate adaptations to present and future extreme heat."

As an interdisciplinary team covering epidemiology, physiology, biometeorology, public health, and climate science, we hypothesize reasons for the physiology-epidemiology disconnect around humidity (summarized in Tables 2 and 3). Our explanations span issues with epidemiological analyses, health and weather data limitations, and physiological reasons that may limit the influence of humidity in actual heat waves as opposed to idealized thermal chambers. These hypotheses are intended to galvanize research to bridge these knowledge gaps."

Climate scientists can develop a nuanced understanding of how temperature and humidity extremes covary on diurnal and longer timescales, of the meteorology of moist heat waves in the present, and of how such events could change with global warming. Epidemiologists can carefully consider how humidity is incorporated into their models, determine whether humidity’s discernible role depends on the cause of mortality or hospitalization, explore robustness of conclusions to higher temporal resolutions of data, and seek to incorporate more records from the tropics, LMICs, and places where temperature and humidity are less correlated."
