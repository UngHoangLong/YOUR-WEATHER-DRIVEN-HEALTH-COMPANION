https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10083291/,"Abstract Background Cold exposure has been considered an essential risk factor for the global disease burden, while its role in cardiovascular diseases is still underappreciated. The increase in frequency and duration of extreme cold weather events like cold spells makes it an urgent task to evaluate the effects of ambient cold on different types of cardiovascular disease and to understand the factors contributing to the population's vulnerability. Methods In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane. We included original research that explored the association between cold exposure (low temperature and cold spell) and cardiovascular disease outcomes (mortality and morbidity). We did a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the relative risk (RR) of the association between a 1°C decrease in temperature or cold spells and cardiovascular disease outcomes."

Results In total, we included 159 studies in the meta-analysis.

Introduction Climate change has a significant impact on human health and has become a global health concern (1–3). Global disease burden 2019 reported that non-optimal temperatures accounted for 1.01 million deaths in males and 0.946 million in females (1). Despite the long-term warming trends, there is an increase in the number, frequency, and duration of extreme weather events such as cold spells, which makes cold exposure a more significant threat (4, 5). It has been reported that for every 1°C temperature decrease below the reference point, the rate of non-accidental mortality increases by 4% (6)."

In many countries, CVD mortality is higher in winter than in summer (7, 8). As reported, sudden exposure to low temperatures could disturb cardiovascular activity (9, 10).

Here, we analyzed the cold effects in different climate conditions by stratifying the included articles using the Köppen–Geiger climate zones classification (20). As the results showed, the increased mortality caused by low-temperature exposure was more pronounced in a location with a higher mean daily temperature, such as the tropical climate zone (24.23°C; RR 1.023), Mediterranean climate zone (20.19°C; RR 1.024), and subtropical climate zone (19.78°C; RR1.032).

Locations with higher mean temperatures tend to have higher optimal temperatures and to be intolerant to a fall in temperature, probably through physical adaptation (1). More importantly, social adaptation may play an even more critical role, as it is a known fact that the susceptible population, such as the elderly and patients with cardiovascular disease, should wear protective clothing and remain active in cold weather outdoors (29). However, The Eurowinter Group reported that in relatively warm countries, such a population often does not follow such practices because they do not feel the need (30)."

They found the risk of a fatal heart attack was twice as high as usual when temperatures ranged from 83 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit for four days and fine particulate pollution measured above 37.5 micrograms per cubic meter. That exceeds the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which recommend that people avoid exposure to more than 15 micrograms per cubic meter more than three to four days a year. Researchers found an 18% increase in the risk of a deadly heart attack during two-day heat waves."

The chances of dying from a heart attack rose by 4% during two-day cold spells when temperatures ranged from 33 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit.

Dehydration may influence heart attack risk during periods of intense heat, the researchers wrote in the study, while elevated blood pressure and contracting blood vessels could raise the risk of a deadly heart attack on cold days. The combination of heat and pollution may elevate heart attack risk because people may breathe faster and harder on sweltering days, causing them to inhale even more harmful microscopic particles than usual, the authors said."

Limitations of the Study The study has limitations, according to the doctors interviewed. For one, it didn’t prove extreme weather or polluted air causes fatal heart attacks, only that there is an association between these outdoor conditions and heart attack deaths, noted Reed. The results may also only apply to some regions and populations, Matthew Tomey, MD, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Health."

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5777598/?utm_source=chatgpt.com,"Abstract Many features of the environment have been found to exert an important influence on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, progression, and severity. Changes in the environment due to migration to different geographic locations, modifications in lifestyle choices, and shifts in social policies and cultural practices alter CVD risk, even in the absence of genetic changes. Nevertheless, the cumulative impact of the environment on CVD risk has been difficult to assess and the mechanisms by which some environment factors influence CVD remain obscure. Human environments are complex; and their natural, social and personal domains are highly variable due to diversity in human ecosystems, evolutionary histories, social structures, and individual choices. Accumulating evidence supports the notion that ecological features such as the diurnal cycles of light and day, sunlight exposure, seasons, and geographic characteristics of the natural environment such altitude, latitude and greenspaces are important determinants of cardiovascular health and CVD risk."

In highly developed societies, the influence of the natural environment is moderated by the physical characteristics of the social environments such as the built environment and pollution, as well as by socioeconomic status and social networks. These attributes of the social environment shape lifestyle choices that significantly modify CVD risk.

Deaths from ischemic heart disease and stroke have increased worldwide. Even in the US, where the rates of CVD mortality have been steadily decreasing from their peak in the 1960s, this rate of decline has substantially slowed down since the 1990s1, and by 2030, 40.5% of the population is projected to have some form of CVD.2 While some of this increase may be due to an aging population, the near universal pervasiveness of CVD reflects our inability to prevent its escalating occurrence or to understand its fundamental nature. The received view is that CVD is due to a set of chronic conditions that arise from a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental influences that lead to progressive deterioration in the structure and the function of cardiovascular tissues. It is generally believed that even though genetic defects underlie some infrequent forms of heart disease, most CVD is due to interactions between several gene variants and lifestyle factors."

Data combined from both these studies show that 47% of stroke in women and 35% in men could be attributed to the lack of adherence to low-risk lifestyle choices.4 In a cohort of Swedish women low-risk behavior was associated with a 92% decrease in risk of myocardial infarction (MI).5 Taken together, these data suggest that, for the most part (50–90%), CVD is a modifiable and preventable condition.

This is most strikingly demonstrated by data from China, which show that the age-adjusted CVD mortality rates in Beijing increased by 50% for men and 27% for women due to environmental changes between 1984 and 1999.6 Changing environmental conditions have also been linked to a 75% decrease in CVD risk in Finland within 20 years,7 and a 24% drop in coronary mortality in Poland in 9 years.8 In England and Wales the mortality rate for coronary heart disease (CHD) between 1981 and 2000 have decreased by 62% in men and 45% in women; and more than half of this decline was attributed to a reduction in environmental risk factors.9 Additionally, a recent study of the decrease in CHD deaths from 1980 to 2000 in the US suggested that approximately 44% of the decrease could be attributable to environmental changes.10 Additional support for modifiable nature of CVD risk comes from migrant studies showing that moving to a new environment could substantively modify CVD risk. Data collected between 1960s–1970s indicate a significant increase in the rates of CHD deaths in Japanese men who moved from Japan to the US.11 Similarly, Indians living in the UK12 have higher CVD risk than their counterparts living in India."

The primacy of the environment is further enforced by studies on genetically-identical twins. In a study of Finnish immigrants it was found that those who moved to Sweden had lower rates of CHD than those living in Finland;13 and this decrease in risk was evident even in migrant twins, suggesting that changes in the environment modify CVD risk, independent of genetics."

Myocardial infarctions occur most frequently between 6 – 12 PM (mostly between 3 – 6 AM),17, 18 and are 3 times more likely to occur in early morning than at night.

Myocardial infarcts that occur in the middle of the night are larger22 and angioplasties performed at night are less successful.23 A similar circadian dependence has been observed in animals; mice subjected to coronary ligation at the sleep-to-wake transition exhibit a dramatic increase in myocardial infarct size compared with those at the wake-to-sleep transition,24 indicating that the extent of tissue injury depends upon the circadian phase, synchronized with the day/night cycle.

In England and Wales the winter peak accounts for 20,000 additional deaths per year,39 in the US 53% more cases of MI are reported in winter than in summer.40 This increase in mortality may be because in winter, the elderly succumb to CVD due to exacerbation of pre-existing disease,41 or respiratory infections that trigger an acute phase response.

Cold outdoor ambient temperature, by itself, may be an important factor, as colder days, both in winter and in summer, are associated with an excessive number of infarctions.42 Exposure to ambient cold temperature increases vascular resistance and blood pressure, leading to an increase in oxygen demand,43, 44 and in the Framingham Offspring Cohort, ambient temperature was found to be a strong determinant of microvascular function.45 Cold ambient temperature can also increase coronary artery resistance or induce coronary vasospasm and has been linked to acute myocardial infarction,46, 47 and acute presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysms.47 However, low temperatures do not appear to be the only important factor, because excessive mortality during winter months has also been reported in areas where there is little seasonal change in temperature e.g., Los Angeles.48"

While ambient cold temperatures are linked to acute cardiovascular events, high temperatures may be equally significant.

Sunlight exposure could affect CVD risk for many reasons, but the most well supported hypothesis relates to vitamin D, which is synthesized only in the presence of sunlight. However, the efficiency of this photosynthetic process depends upon the number of photons that penetrate the endothelium, which in turn depends upon the extent of melanin pigmentation of the skin.55 Therefore, individuals with darker skin require longer exposure to sunlight to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D as those with lighter skin. Because exposure to UVB radiation is essential for this process, the efficiency of vitamin D depends upon the level of UVB radiation reaching the earth’s surface."

Because exposure to UVB radiation is essential for this process, the efficiency of vitamin D depends upon the level of UVB radiation reaching the earth’s surface. When the sun is low in the sky (during winter or during early morning and late evening) incoming radiation has to travel longer and is subject to more scattering and absorption than when the sun is directly overhead. Consequently, the ability of synthesize vitamin D is affected by the time of the day, the season and the latitude. As a result, there is greater prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in fall and winter than in summer and spring.56, 57 Seasonal and latitudinal variations in vitamin D levels have been associated with geographic and seasonal variations in blood pressure."

Species native to mountainous areas (yaks, pika) have better cardiopulmonary responses than domestic animals recently transported to high altitudes.78 In lowlanders not adapted to high altitude ascent to high altitude (>2500 m) results in an increase in pulmonary artery pressure due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). This is usually accompanied by increased erythropoiesis, and an increased pressure load on the right ventricle.79 If the ascent is slow, the changes are well tolerated by otherwise healthy individuals, but in susceptible individuals, or when the ascent is rapid, pulmonary edema develops due to uneven HPV and high capillary pressures in the lung, leading to an extensive inflammatory response."

Meta-analyses of over 60 studies show that aspects of the built environment are positively correlated with obesity111, particularly in disadvantaged groups112.

The link between air pollution exposure and cardiovascular disease is supported by extensive evidence from animal models, which show that in controlled conditions, increased exposure to concentration ambient particles increases atherogenesis, insulin resistance, and thrombosis.123 While this evidence attests to the biological plausibility of the relationship between CVD and air pollution, the underlying mechanisms remain opaque; however, unraveling physiological and molecular mechanisms, is critical to understand how air pollution exposure affects cardiovascular health, which specific conditions regulate individual susceptibility to PM toxicity and how the CVD burden of PM could be mitigated.

Inhalation of PM could create a state of heightened inflammation, by a “spillover” of proinflammatory or oxidative mediators from the lung to systemic circulation. This could lead to endothelial dysfunction and increased thrombosis that chronically could result in hypertension and accelerated atherogenesis. A spillover effect is consistent with recent observations showing that oxidants generated in the lung by PM exposure could accelerate the formation of atherosclerotic lesions147 and that increased superoxide dismutation in the lung could prevent PM-induced insulin resistance.148 Additionally, activation of several lung receptors and nerve endings by PM could lead to change in heart rate, heart rate variability and electrocardiographic changes reflective of an increase in sympathetic tone."

While our understanding of the contribution of each of these factors to CVD risk is still in its infancy, both human and animal studies show that maternal hypercholesterolemia is associated with an increase in fatty streak formation in fetal arteries. The Fate of Early Lesions in Children (FELIC) study showed that the progression of atherosclerosis was markedly faster in offspring of hypercholesterolemic than normocholesterolemic mothers.166 Thus the disease risk burden of the mother is at least partially transmitted to the fetus.

The disease stems largely from living in unconducive environments, and is sustained, in part, by a state of constant dyssynchrony with the rhythms of the natural environment and a mismatch between our ancient genes and our contemporary environments. This view provides a new perspective on CVD prevention and treatment, which suggests that enduring gains against the disease may be made by investigations into environmental origins of the disease, investigations that might be beyond the confines of the laboratory or the clinic, but within the domain of empiric inquiry.

As discussed, much of CVD is preventable and since the 1960s, primary prevention has been the major reason for the decline in CVD mortality.1 In comparison with improved clinical care and treatment, preventive measures are likely to garner more widespread and enduring gains and, if not cost-prohibitive, could be adopted worldwide, even in resource-poor countries, which now seemed destined to bear the largest brunt of this epidemic. But most prevention strategies to date have been focused on individual interventions."

But most prevention strategies to date have been focused on individual interventions. However, if a majority of CVD is attributable to the environment, more widespread gains against the disease could be accrued by collective actions such as restructuring cities, minimizing pollution, increasing access to better nutrition, walkable areas, and urban greenspaces, rather than targeting individual behaviors and choices alone. Additional gains could be accrued by addressing both temporal and genetic dyssynchrony with the environment, in order to develop more individualized preventive approaches, approaches that recognize that each individuals is a unique product of his or her evolutionary, social and cultural history. Such a recognition of the role of the environment may also help in addressing social, economic and cultural differences that fuel and sustain health disparities, even in affluent societies."

But to fully redeem the promise of this approach, we would have to commit significant resources to this line of investigation, which has traditionally received less attention and funding than other approaches. But given the predominant role of the environment, unprecedented efforts have to be made to assess individually the impact of the natural, social and personal domains of the environment, and to understand how these domains influence the effects of other domains, and how such interactions collectively affect CVD. Hence, the challenge to future investigators is not only to systematically unweave the strands of environmental influences, but to integrate the effects of the various components of the environment into a comprehensive model."

Hence, the challenge to future investigators is not only to systematically unweave the strands of environmental influences, but to integrate the effects of the various components of the environment into a comprehensive model. Such a model might explain how the effects of the natural environment are moderated or amplified by the social and personal environments and how the effects of the social and personal environment are limited or modified by the natural environment. Much work remains to done to develop and test such a model, but even an incremental advance in our understanding of the environmental bases of CVD might help in devising more effective prevention and intervention strategies that could meaningfully slow down or halt the ominous progression and spread of CVD in modern societies."
