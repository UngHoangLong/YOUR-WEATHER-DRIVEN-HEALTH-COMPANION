For example, when there’s a notable increase in air humidity (such as after heavy rainfall), there tends to be an equal increase in symptom-causing mold in the environment. Mold, a type of microscopic fungus, contains spores that—similarly to pollen—are released into the air and can trigger a variety of allergy symptoms. Mold spores are at their highest during times of hot, humid weather conditions, and can also be exacerbated by improper cleaning of air conditioning systems. It's worth noting that a sudden drop in air humidity can also affect your airways, leaving them dry and potentially more vulnerable to react to allergenic substances, fungi, viruses, and bacteria."

It's worth noting that a sudden drop in air humidity can also affect your airways, leaving them dry and potentially more vulnerable to react to allergenic substances, fungi, viruses, and bacteria. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the ideal level of relative humidity is between 40% and 70%. Alternately, the body tends to be more susceptible to respiratory illnesses when the index is far below the recommended level (at 20% or 30%). Rainfall and heavy winds from thunderstorms can also impact allergy symptoms in those with seasonal allergies in a variety of ways."

Rainfall and heavy winds from thunderstorms can also impact allergy symptoms in those with seasonal allergies in a variety of ways. Since rain typically causes pollen to drop, it can temporarily lessen symptoms, while heavy winds (such as during a thunderstorm) can cause pollen and mold spores to become more airborne and, therefore, more transmissible. Can Climate Change Worsen Allergy Symptoms? Global warming has the potential to worsen allergy symptoms for at least 25 million Americans, according to a report by the National Wildlife Foundation and Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America."

Global warming has the potential to worsen allergy symptoms for at least 25 million Americans, according to a report by the National Wildlife Foundation and Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. This report predicts that, if left unchecked, climate change could lead to extended growing periods for a number of symptom-triggering respiratory allergens—such as ragweed pollen and tree pollen—and skin allergens like poison ivy. It also reported that the spring season now arrives, on average, 10 to 14 days earlier than it did 20 years ago. All of these factors, in turn, may increase the length of peak allergy seasons and the prevalence and duration of symptom flare-ups among allergy sufferers."

All of these factors, in turn, may increase the length of peak allergy seasons and the prevalence and duration of symptom flare-ups among allergy sufferers. Respiratory allergies, which can be intensified by changes in climate, usually cause a series of symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as runny nose, sneezing, and red, itchy eyes. Allergic rhinitis flare-ups, in particular, tend to be quite common in periods of drastic temperature change, which may be affected by ongoing climate change, although research is ongoing. Climate Change, Air Pollution, and Allergies Climate change may also have the potential to affect individuals with respiratory allergies by worsening air pollution and air quality."

Climate Change, Air Pollution, and Allergies Climate change may also have the potential to affect individuals with respiratory allergies by worsening air pollution and air quality. This is especially true for densely-populated cities, where both pollen production and pollution are exacerbated by the “heat island effect,” where buildings and other surfaces absorb and trap heat. The continued emission of greenhouse gasses in the environment contributes to the increase in temperature, and therefore, can lead to changes in the relative air humidity and the intensity and frequency of climate events. All of this directly impacts the presence of allergens in the atmosphere, which, in turn, tends to aggravate the symptoms of those who suffer from respiratory allergies."

Alternately, the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may also act as a fertilizer for plants.

Then Kamble saw a flyer for a free eye check-up clinic near her home in Jambhali village, in India’s Maharashtra state. The doctor there suggested immediate cataract surgery and said that overexposure to solar radiation had likely contributed to her deteriorating eyesight. Kamble, now 55, had for decades worked long hours in the scorching heat without sunglasses or shade."

But in recent years, researchers have found another causative factor for cataracts and other eye disorders: climate change. Climate change is increasing risk to eye health in multiple ways. First, it is making the planet hotter — Earth’s average surface temperature in 2024 was the warmest on record."

First, it is making the planet hotter — Earth’s average surface temperature in 2024 was the warmest on record. Body temperatures reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) can cause heat stroke, a condition that disrupts biological processes throughout the body. In the eyes, heat stroke damages the natural defense systems that normally counteract the buildup of harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species, explains Lucía Echevarría-Lucas, an ophthalmologist at the Hospital of La Axarquía in Spain’s Málaga province. The eye lens is made up of crystalline proteins that must remain organized to remain transparent."

Reactive oxygen species can damage these proteins, “forming opacities that lead to cataracts,” Echevarría-Lucas says. Since the lens can’t regenerate the proteins, the more time one spends in the heat, the greater the risk of developing cataracts. In a study spanning 10 years in southern Spain, Echevarría-Lucas and her colleagues found an additional 370.8 cases of cataracts per 100,000 inhabitants for each degree Celsius rise in the maximum average temperature each year."

And though the typical age of onset of cataracts is 60 or older, cataracts in people aged 15 to 49 were more common in regions where a high percentage of people work in agriculture. Another way global warming is contributing to eye disorders is by increasing our exposure to UV radiation, according to Echevarría-Lucas and study coauthor José María Senciales González, a geographer at the University of Málaga. Some of this is driven by behavior — people tend to spend more time outdoors when it’s warm."

But in some places, such as Southern California and the Costa del Sol in Spain, hot, dry winds sap from the air water vapor that would normally absorb UV radiation, causing more UV exposure. UV radiation also generates reactive oxygen species that damage the eye lens, and can directly damage the DNA of lens cells, Echevarría-Lucas adds. Cataracts are one of the most common causes of vision impairment worldwide."

These include keratitis — an inflammation of the cornea, the eye’s clear, outermost layer — pterygium, an overgrowth of fleshy pink tissue over the white part of the eye (called the sclera) and conjunctivitis, an eye infection or irritation also called pinkeye, notes Yee Ling Wong , an ophthalmologist-in-training at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital in the UK and coauthor of a 2024 overview in the Journal of Climate Change and Health. One 2023 study of nearly 60,000 people in Ürümqi, in northwestern China, found that temperatures exceeding 28.7°C — just 83°F — increased the risk of conjunctivitis by roughly 16 percent compared to daily temperatures around 10.7°C, or 51°F."

Longer pollen seasons and increased mold growth, both of which have been linked to climate change, are also contributing to an uptick in conjunctivitis caused by allergies, says ophthalmologist Malik Kahook at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Beyond these direct impacts, climate-driven droughts cause food insecurity that can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as copper and vitamins B12, B1 and B9 , that risk damaging the optic nerve. During droughts, people are often forced to use unsafe water, which also increases the risk of eye infections."

First and foremost, outdoor workers should be given sufficient shade and frequent breaks to cool down, says Jesús Rodrigo Comino, a geographer at the University of Granada and a coauthor of the Spanish study. He also recommends wearing a hat with a visor that shields the eyes, as well as UV-filter sunglasses: Sunglasses offer nearly 38 percent more protection than not wearing them, Rodrigo Comino says."
